# 3cxSimCalls
3CX have recently increased their licence costs dramatically. The costs are based on simultaneous calls, but there doesn't seem to be a way to find your highest ever simultaneous call usage, so I wrote this.

Download your unfiltered call log (Reporting>Call Log>Export), put it in the same folder as the script and run the script

It will take **a while**

Output csv file should give you every second during the 90 days and how many simultaneous calls there were during that second (if there were more than 3 calls because otherwise the file would be biiiig).

Is it slow and inefficient? You betcha!

Is it accurate? I hope so because I've just used it to halve our licence, which means I'm paying less than before ~~the greedy sods incresed it~~ inflation forced them to reluctantly raise their prices.
